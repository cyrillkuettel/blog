# Some notes: 
These are the development commands.


 For production, refer to the commands in the run-production.sh file in the top-level dirtory. 
It might be neccessary to run the docker command which runs jekyll build (below) before pushing all the files, ssh into the server and running 




docker run --rm --volume="/home/cyrill/blog/web:/srv/jekyll" -it jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll build

docker run --name cyrill_blog --volume="/home/cyrill/blog/web:/srv/jekyll" -p 4000:4000 -it jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll serve --watch --drafts
# restart: 
docker start cyrill_blog

# Issues Troubleshooting when posts not appearing
1. Check if the date is not in the future.
2. Run the two commands above
