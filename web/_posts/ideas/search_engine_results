Is it just me, or have search results become garbage for most sites?

 
In my subjective experience, they've becomse wore and worse over the last couple of years.
the first page of google search results seems to have degenerated to a SEO-Battle. A lot of times, when I search something, there is nothing of value, only sites which try to sell me something or sites which are obviously not written by human beings. 


Guess thatâ€™s what happens when everyone fights over SEO and you end up where you left off.

The amount of times I've found results from websites like GitMemory that basically rehosts GitHub issues is insane.
