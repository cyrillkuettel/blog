While university should be a place where students discover who they are and what they are interested in, oftentimes they are instead performing for their professors to "get the grade." So, they turn into the people they think their professors want them to be, instead of creative, critical thinkers in their own right. In this way, kohn-1993 writes, "grades... reduce a student's sense of control over his own fate and can induce a blind conformity to other' whishes."
