# Books
I've always like to read books. I mostly read novels, however, from time to time I will read a technical book.

# Design Patterns

In  my experience, a lot of technical solutions in software / boil down to the same patterns, which are generally applicable.
For this reason (and because everybody talks about it) I decided to read this book
I'm on page 10 and I can already sense, that this is not going to be a light read. However, I know that I will learn a lot from this book.  Not only because the examples are in C++, also because the book goes very in-depth (which is a good thing!).</p>

# Notes

While reading, I will summarize what I think is important.
