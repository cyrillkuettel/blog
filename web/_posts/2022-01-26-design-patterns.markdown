# Reading
I read a lot. I prefer to read fiction. From time to time, I do read books about programming, software development and various topics surrounding that area. I decided to pick up "Gang of Four" Design Patterns.

A lot of elegant solutions in software can be reduced to the same patterns. In a lot of cases it boils down to a few techniques. 
I decided to read this book because I read a lot about it. It's over twenty years old, but still relevant today. 
I'm on page 10 and I can already sense this is not going to be a quick read. However, I'm certain I can lear a lot from this book. 
So let's get started then!</p>
