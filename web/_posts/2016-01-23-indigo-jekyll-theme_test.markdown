# Idea
Ever wanted to work on the same system, everywhere, anytime, *without* relying on VNC, ssh or similar
protocols? 

I work on two computers. Because of this, they share a lot of the same software. This introduces a
lot of redundancy. Why? Because both systems have a nearly identical set of software installed. This means if you 
install new software, you have to do it two times. I have realised that this is not a very good long-term strategy.

# Solution
You can actually run an operating system on a external storage medium. For example, you could use a bootable USB device,
or, even better an external ssd.  Then you just plug it in and boot from it.
