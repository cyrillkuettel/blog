## Introduction
Ever since I first interacted with a computer, I feel like being thrown into a world of infinite possibilities. I started writing programs at age 14. This further reinforced that notion. What's so intriguing about computers, to my mind, is the fact that you can literally invent new thnings out of thin air.   
## Making Progress

I regularly had to write a feature of a software system that seems impossible at first sight, _and then I get it done_. 
I'm beginning to think that everything is possible.

Of course, that line of thought is a typical fallacy. [Dunning Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) comes to mind here. 
Everything is possible in theory. From that set, a large subset is also possible in practice. Writing software is like being a craftsman, only that you are not limited by resources and all tools are at your fingertips.

## If something doesn't exist, you can invent it.
I want to expand on that analogy. 
Let's imagine you are a carpenter. You want to build a nice piece of furniture, but the problem is, you require a special tool that costs a thousand dollars. In computers, the same kind of limitation hardly exists. 
Software is not limited by physics, like wood for example. It is limited by imagination, by design, by organization.
If you are in a similar situation as the carpenter, as a software engineer, let's say the work you do requires a very specialized tool. You can just _install_ free software. This has essentially the effect of "standing on the shoulders of giants."  You can leverage your potential a ten-fold, a hundred-fold. An example of this version control software Git. I cannot imagine what I would do without this marvelous piece of software.
If a tool does not exist (which by the way is highly unlikely) you can literally just _write_ it. Just code a tool into existence. That's how a lot of great software came into existence: Someone was in need of a something, realized the thing he needs does not exist - and therefore he went on to write it. 

Build simple tools, on which you can then construct more complex tools. 

## Use the appropriate tool
Talking about inventing tools, this reminds of a point Dough Engelbart (inventor of the computer mouse) has made.
> Engelbart interviewed job candidates, he would hand them a pencil with a brick attached to it with masking tape and ask them to write their name.
If our writing tools were that unwieldy (= awkward to handle), he would demonstrate, people would never have learned to write.

## My motivation
There is another point to be made here: Better tools (like a pen in his example) can in a sense expand the scope of your mind. Imagine we never invented pens (Or keyboards).
What I've described here is my vision. I want to build things. I always empathized with "Daniel DÃ¼sentrieb" (English: Gyro Gearloose). Inventing new things is so interesting because _theory often follows invention._ I always liked this. I do enjoy inventing, "tinkering" and solving puzzles.
