## Inventing
Ever since I first interacted with a computer, I feel like being thrown into a world of infinite possibilities. I started writing programs at around age 14. This further reinforced that notion. What's so intriguing about programming, to my mind, is the fact that you can invent new things out of nothing.   

So many times in my life, I wanted to write a feature of a program, that seemed impossible at first sight, _and then I got it done_. 
I'm beginning to think that everything is possible. Yes you heard right.
One has to be quite deluded to actually fully believe this.

Writing about this, this reminds be of the famous [Dunning Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) 
So let me rephrase the sentence: Everything is possible _in theory._ From that set, a large subset is also possible in practice. That has been my experience so far. Software allows an immeasurable amount of creative freedom. What do you do if you encounter a really serious problem as a computer programmer? You invent a world in which the problem doesn't exist.

## If it doesn't exist, invent it.
Writing software is kind of like being a craftsman, only that you are not that limited by resources. All tools, all information is out there, available at your fingertips. 
Let's imagine you are a carpenter. You want to build a nice piece of furniture, but the problem is, you require a special tool that costs a thousand dollars. In a software, this kind of limitation is rare. 


If you are in a similar situation, as a software engineer, chances are you can just _install_ that tool. Software is not limited by physics. It is limited by imagination, by design, by organization. Free software is a prominent example. As a developer you can build on top of software that other people have written. You literally stand on the shoulders of giants. This allows you to leverage your potential a ten-fold, a hundred-fold, a thousand-fold. An example of this version control software Git. I cannot imagine what I would do without this marvelous piece of software. Same with Docker. Docker removes the 'it works on my machine' moment. 

If a tool does not exist (which by the way is highly unlikely) you can literally just _write_ it. Just code a tool into existence. That's how actually how a lot of great software came into existence: 
1. Someone was in need of a particular tool.
2. They realized that this thing does not exist.
3. They went ahead and invented it.
Very simple 3-step process. I think a general motive is: Build simple tools. These tools then can build the foundational structure for more complex tools. With increased complexity often comes more power.

## Tools and Dough
Talking about inventing tools, this reminds of Dough Engelbart. He's famous for inventing the computer mouse, among many other things. He made a very interesting example on the importance of good tools.
> Engelbart interviewed job candidates, he would hand them a pencil with a brick attached to it with masking tape and ask them to write their name.
If our writing tools were that unwieldy (= awkward to handle), he would demonstrate, people would never have learned to write.

The results were of course hilarious. If pens did not exist in, like we know them, no one would write.


There is another point to be made here: Better tools (like a pen in his example) can in a sense expand the scope of your mind. Imagine we never invented pens (Or keyboards).
What I've described here is my inspiration. I want to build things. I always empathized with "Daniel DÃ¼sentrieb" (English: Gyro Gearloose). Inventing new things is so interesting because _theory often follows invention._ I always liked this. I do enjoy inventing, "tinkering" and solving puzzles.
