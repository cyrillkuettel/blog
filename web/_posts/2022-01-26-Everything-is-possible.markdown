## Inventing
Ever since I first interacted with a computer, I feel like being thrown into a world of infinite possibilities. I started writing programs at around age 14. This further reinforced that notion. What's so intriguing about programming, to my mind, is the fact that you can invent new things out of nothing.   
## Forward, ever forward!

So many times in my life, I wanted to write a feature of a program, that seemed to be impossible to write at first sight, _and then I got it done_. 
I'm beginning to think that everything is possible. Yes, I know what you're thinking.
One has to be quite deluded to actually fully believe this.

Writing about this, this reminds be of the famous [Dunning Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) 
So let me rephrase the sentence: Everything is possible _in theory._ From that set, a large subset is also possible in practice. That has been my experience so far. Software allows an immeasurable amount of creative freedom. What do you do if you encounter a really serious problem as a computer programmer? You invent a world in which the problem doesn't exist.

## If something doesn't exist, you can invent it.
Writing software is kind of like being a craftsman, only that you are not that limited by resources. All tools, all information are out there, at your fingertips. I like this craftsman analogy.
Let's imagine you are a carpenter. You want to build a nice piece of furniture, but the problem is, you require a special tool that costs a thousand dollars. In a software, this kind of limitation is rare. 
Software is not limited by physics. It is limited by imagination, by design, by organization.
If you are in a similar situation as the carpenter, as a software engineer, let's say the work you do requires a very specialized tool. You can just _install_ that tool. Free software is a prominent example. Building on top of software, that other people have created, is comparable "standing on the shoulders of giants." You can leverage your potential a ten-fold, a hundred-fold. An example of this version control software Git. I cannot imagine what I would do without this marvelous piece of software.
If a tool does not exist (which by the way is highly unlikely) you can literally just _write_ it. Just code a tool into existence. That's how actually how a lot of great software came into existence: 
1. Someone was in need of a particular tool.
2. They realized that this thing does not exist.
3. They went ahead and invented it.
Very simple 3-step process. I think a general motive is: Build simple tools. These tools then can build the foundational structure for more complex tools. With increased complexity often comes more power.

## How tools leverage your development
Talking about inventing tools, this reminds of Dough Engelbart. He's famous for inventing the computer mouse, among many other things. He made a very interesting example on the importance of good tools.
> Engelbart interviewed job candidates, he would hand them a pencil with a brick attached to it with masking tape and ask them to write their name.
If our writing tools were that unwieldy (= awkward to handle), he would demonstrate, people would never have learned to write.

The results were of course hilarious. If pens did not exist in, like we know them, no one would write.

## My motivation
There is another point to be made here: Better tools (like a pen in his example) can in a sense expand the scope of your mind. Imagine we never invented pens (Or keyboards).
What I've described here is my vision. I want to build things. I always empathized with "Daniel DÃ¼sentrieb" (English: Gyro Gearloose). Inventing new things is so interesting because _theory often follows invention._ I always liked this. I do enjoy inventing, "tinkering" and solving puzzles.
