I'm beginning to feel like I can do anything. 
Not gonna lie, the more software I write that seems at first impossible, the more I'm beginning to think everything is possible. That's also what fasciates me so much about this discipline: Programming. Everything is possible in theory. A lot is possible in practice. It's like being a wood craftsman but you are not limited by your tools. 
I think this analogy fits: 
Let's imagine you are a carpenter. You want to build a nice artefact, but the problem is, you need a very special saw that costs a lot of money.
well, if you are in the same situation as a software developer, let's say you need a special tool. You can just _download_ that tool. Stand on the shoulders of giants and use a open-source tool. 
If it does not exist, which is highly unlikely, you can literally just _write it_. Code new tools. Build simple tools, on which you can then construct more complex tools. If something doesn't exist, you can invent it. 
What I've described here is my vision. I like building things. I always liked "Daniel DÃ¼sentrieb" (english: Gyro Gearloose) Inventing new things is so interesting, because _theory often follows invention._

In  my experience, a lot of technical solutions in software / boil down to the same patterns, which are generally applicable.
For this reason (and because everybody talks about it) I decided to read Gang of four.
I'm on page 10 and I can already sense, that this is not going to be a light read. However, I know that I will learn a lot from this book.  Not only because the examples are in C++, also because the book goes very in-depth (which is a good thing!). 

# Notes

While reading, I will summarize what I think is important.
