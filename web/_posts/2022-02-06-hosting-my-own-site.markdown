description: Hosting my own website
---

Building this site and its infrastructure has been a very enjoyable process. It has been a wonderful journey. I learned a lot, particularly docker, docker-compose and server configurations. 
This website is mainly a place where I collect useful information. I document stuff I work on or that I find interesting. Although all posts right now are in English, I'll write some in German as well. 
## Server configuration: A learning experience
I did learn quite a lot in this process. Especially because I host this thing myself. I learned how to set up a VPS server. It was initially challenging, but very rewarding indeed. I love the independence that comes with it. I can do whatever I want, no strings attached.
There are lots of solutions that can help you set up your own site quickly and easily. However, they almost always come at the price of being dependent on some third-party provider. So, I decided to build everything myself, including the web server. 
## Freedom as motivation
My setup maximizes independence. That's something I like very much. So the idea is that even if something goes horribly wrong with on the host, I can just pack my stuff and `docker-compose up` on another server. 

To me, this is worth the extra hassle of settings things up.
