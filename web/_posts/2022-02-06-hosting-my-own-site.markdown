description: Hosting my own website
---

I very much enjoy writing and building my own site. It has been a wonderful journey. Not only did I learn configuring my own server, this project can also help me to refine my writing skills. Although all posts right now are in English, I'll write some in German as well. 
## Server configuration and other tales
I did learn quite a lot in this process. Especially because I host this site myself. I learned how to set up a VPS server. It was initially challenging, but very rewarding indeed. I love the independence that comes with it. I can do whatever I want, no strings attached.
There are lots of solutions that can help you set up your own site quickly and easily. However, they almost always come at the price of being dependent on some third-party provider. 

My setup maximized independence. Even if something goes wrong with the VPS, I can just pack my stuff and `docker-compose up` on another server. 

To me, this is worth the extra hassle of settings things up.
