# Differnce prod / dev

For technical reasons, that is, because of the nginx configuration, the docker command to go life in the site is different if you're on the server. 

For local development, the only commands that work are the ones in docker_commands_that_worked.txt

The docker-compose stuff is intended to run only on the droplet. (Because the config file has to specify the url, essentially)

NOTE: I think you have to run the docker jekyll build command before he compose stuff works. I thinks is the case because that command will generate all the static files. 
PS: Forlocal development you have to exactly visit 'localhost:4000' (without https)

Displaying the quotes at random is more complicated than I first thought. 
the idea is to use the title and use a quote for each page.
