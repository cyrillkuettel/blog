# Upload files

scp local_file user@remote_host:remote_file

# Differnce prod / dev

For technical reasons, that is, because of the nginx configuration, the docker command to go life in the site is different if you're on the server. 

For local development, the only commands that work are the ones in docker_commands_that_worked.txt

The docker-compose stuff is intended to run only on the droplet. (Because the config file has to specify the url, essentially)

PS: For local development you have to exactly visit 'localhost:4000' (without https)


If you're updating the server, you probably have to first run test-build-for-prod.sh
then stop again with the stop.sh and then finally, run run-prod.sh
